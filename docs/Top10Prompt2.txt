That's a brilliant list. Thank you. So have a go at creating one scenario for issue no. 1. The format I need is a prompt that sets up the scenario - can be quite detailed, say 50-100 words. Then three at least credible responses. Again ~50 words each. Some of the responses could deliberately 'lead the wrong way' i.e. pick up on naive interpretations and brittle assessments. The user has to rate each response (1-5) before the expert ratings are shown to compare. All responses have to be rated and once the 'reveal' is done they can't be changed. For each response there is an expert rating (1-5) at least one (but not always one) rating has to be 5 i.e. there has to be a 'best' approach as adjudged by 'the experts'. The other two responses will vary according to the specific scenario. It's plausible than in some case it may be a 'close call' ... ratings 3,5,4. In other cases we may be able to show an option which a naive consultant rates as 4 say, but the experts rate as 1 - likely for client politics, team dynamics, commercial or even ethical reasons. Then along with the rating, there is the expert rationale for the rating. This is where the insights should land. Sometime the rationale will be a broader explanation of the mindset, orientation, behaviours that the scenario illustrates. That's quite a long brief. Is it clear? Any questions?
