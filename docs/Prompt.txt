I have a React / Next PWA web app in development. It's a simple B-B app that presents business scenarios to the user and three possible responses. They rate each response and then compare with the expert ratings and the rationale for each of those ratings. Its designed to run on desktop and mobile. I use store and persist to handle all state so that the user can easily pick up and put down the app over the course of a year's 'working through the curriculum' of ~2000 scenarios. Having built the app with components and prop passing I am experiencing all sorts of sync issues. So I've decided to rework the code so that it is completely prop free. I know this is possible given that the store can contain all the state globals I need. I can share all the code so you can help me in this journey. My experience in doing this so far has been very dissappointing with LLMs hallucinating and causing the code to become unstable, so very careful test-as-you-go babysteps is what I'm after. This is a minimal viable demo app, in which the scenarios and modules (there are 49 topics each containing ~ 50 scenarios) are hard-coded into the app. I'm looking to re-architect it to make it as simple as possible. I am a very experienced 'old style' developer but new to web development. I have a Physics MA from Oxford University but even I am shocked by all the abstractions and obtruseness and how quickly a simple bug can become a rabbit hole of inter-related issues. So my philosophy here is to avoid complication and complexity AT ALL COSTS.
