I'm building a B-B app that helps technical consultants and junior consultants become more familiar with the mindset, orientation and judgement calls needed for effective advisory led work. The app will (over the course of a year) present the user with ~ 2000 scenarios organised in 49 topics. For the minimum viable demo I need ten really well constructed scenarios addressing the biggest issues that junior folks (or their managers!) have with advisory-led approaches. Let's start with what the top 10 issues are, and then create the scenarios. Can you do a wide scan to find the top 10 issues?
