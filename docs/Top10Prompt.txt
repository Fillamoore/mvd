I'm building a B-B app that helps technical consultants and junior consultants become more familiar with the knowhow needed in high-stakes situations. The app will (over the course of a year) present the user with ~ 2000 scenarios organised in 49 modules. For the minimum viable trial app I need ten really well chosen 'foundation' modules that cover the most important areas of knowhow early career people need to handle high-stakes situations. Find me the top ten areas of knowhow.
