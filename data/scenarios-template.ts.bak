    prompt: "You’ve just completed a thorough data analysis for a client in the construction sector, showing delays are mainly due to slow approval processes and supply bottlenecks. In tomorrow’s steering meeting, you’re expected to present your findings. The senior client sponsor has limited patience for technical detail and is under pressure from their COO to “just fix it.” Your Manager has hinted that the presentation is a test of your ability to move from analysis to advisory mode.",

        text: "Prepare a comprehensive walkthrough of the analysis, showing each step of the causal chain that led to the conclusions. Demonstrate transparency by highlighting the robustness of methods, then close with the two main findings. Keep the recommendation for the end to avoid jumping to conclusions without evidence.",
        expertRationale: "This is defensible but risks losing the room. It emphasises analysis over action, which satisfies technical transparency but frustrates time-poor executives. The consultant looks thorough but not advisory-minded. Impact is muted because the recommendation comes too late and feels like an afterthought.",

        text: "Open with one sentence: “Two things cause your delays — bottlenecked approvals and unreliable supply.” Immediately follow with three options to address them, briefly outlining trade-offs in speed, cost, and risk. Keep the analysis in the appendix for backup, ready if challenged. Signal readiness to workshop implications right after the meeting.",
        expertRationale: "This is the strongest advisory move: it leads with clarity, frames trade-offs, and offers paths forward. It shows ownership of the insight and orients the conversation toward decisions. The analysis is still available for scrutiny but is not the star. Executives feel heard and guided, not burdened.",

        text: "Summarise findings in a short narrative: “We’ve traced delays through approvals and suppliers — the two choke points. Here’s a simple timeline showing where weeks are lost.” Suggest piloting a fast-track approval lane for one project and a new supplier reliability check. Offer to refine the approach further with the COO’s team.",
        expertRationale: "This option blends analysis with action. The narrative and visualisation humanise the data, and the pilot recommendation is concrete yet contained. It may underplay broader trade-offs, which weakens the advisory stance compared with a structured options framing, but it creates immediate relevance and buy-in.",

    overall: "A is too heavy on analysis; B puts recommendations front and centre, with clear options; C finds a middle ground, weaving story with action. B wins because it shows an advisory mindset under time pressure.",

    prompt: "You’re midway through presenting a diagnostic on supply chain costs. A COO interrupts: “Enough data, what are you recommending?” The room is tense — your Manager is watching how you handle the moment. Your slides are full of process flows and cost drivers, but you’ve not yet landed the recommendation section.",

        text: "Present a very short, one-slide executive summary now that states the top 2 findings, then offer a 10-minute technical appendix walkthrough for anyone who wants detail. Propose a follow-up deep-dive session with the COO and their team to translate the analysis into operational steps if the group wants to proceed.",
        expertRationale: "This is a defensible, consultant-minded move — it preserves rigour while prioritising the exec audience. It signals respect for the COO’s time and keeps technical backup available. The risk: it can feel like hedging if the executive wants a clear recommendation now. Better than raw detail, but less bold than a direct pivot to action.",

Offer to send the full analytical appendix to anyone who wants the numbers afterwards.",
        expertRationale: "This is a textbook advisory response: it validates the stakeholder, converts analysis into decision-relevant language, and gives clear options to move forward. It signals command of the material and prioritises what the executive needs to act. By offering backup later, it preserves credibility and satisfies technical audiences.",

        text: "Make a brief, measured pushback: thank the COO for the candour, explain that the analysis is intended to show causal drivers rather than immediate fixes, and propose a short “options workshop” later that afternoon to co-create pragmatic pilot interventions with the COO and key operators. Stress readiness to tighten the recommendations for their priorities.",
        expertRationale: "This is a collaborative, slightly more assertive choice that turns friction into co-creation. It protects analytical integrity while quickly aligning around action. The risk is that it uses more calendar time and may feel like deferral if the COO wanted an immediate decision. Still, it’s a strong, relationship-building move.",

    overall: "Three credible consultant moves: A keeps rigour with optional detail, B converts insight into immediate decisions, C invites joint problem-solving. B is the cleanest route to influence in the moment, while A and C are defensible alternatives depending on personalities and political context.",
    takeAway: "Give executives the decision they need now — keep the analysis as backup, not the headline."
