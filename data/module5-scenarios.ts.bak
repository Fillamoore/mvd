    prompt: "A large German utility client is on the hook to secure massive winter gas volumes, but the spot prices are running high, like trying to buy tickets to a sold-out concert. Your analysis suggests waiting two weeks might save 8 percent.

Present this as a smart, phased approach.",
        expertRationale: "This is a balanced risk-management approach. It acknowledges the political pressure (CRO satisfaction) while preserving optionality to capture the suggested savings.

        expertRationale: "This is a bold, high-stakes move that could fail spectacularly.

        expertRationale: "This is a shrewd, effective move. It escalates without getting the consulting team's fingerprints on the direct transgression.

        expertRationale: "This is intellectually dishonest and dangerous. Altering the model output to fit consensus destroys the value of independent analysis and introduces unquantified bias.

        expertRationale: "This is a top-down, non-collaborative approach that fails to address the legitimate user complaints.
