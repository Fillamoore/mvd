This allows the current engagement to conclude successfully, securing the immediate win and future opportunity separately.",
        expertRationale: "This is politically safe and prioritises the immediate contract closure and fee collection. The risk is that the client views you as tactically focused, not seeing the whole picture. If the market shifts quickly, your 'future' meeting will feel too late and you will look un-strategic.",

        expertRationale: "This move is high-stakes but shows true advisory value. It sacrifices a clean project closure for the sake of the client's long-term health.

        expertRationale: "This uses political awareness to manage risk internally. It is cautious, protecting the sponsor from a public surprise.

        expertRationale: "This is a good internal team player move that hits revenue targets. Itâ€™s professional services 101: deliver the known win first.

Present this to the client as 'setting the foundation for Phase 2' to manage expectations and ensure future continuity.",
        expertRationale: "This attempts to manage both internal and external priorities, offering a compromise. However, splitting focus often leads to mediocre delivery on both fronts.

        expertRationale: "This is the most strategic stance. It forces an upfront conversation about value vs. revenue, positioning the firm as a genuine partner.

If the systems fail later, your team is protected by the documentation. Offer to provide an 'independent review' of the HR project once your current contract is complete.",

However, it relies on informal mechanisms for critical infrastructure, which is highly risky. The client needs formal governance, not a handshake agreement.",
        expertRanking: 2

        expertRationale: "This follows the contract and avoids confrontation now. It's a pragmatic, incremental approach. The problem is that the structure will likely fail, creating project fatigue and associating your work with failure, making the future Phase 2 conversation much harder.",

Request immediate approval for a short 'Incentive Redesign Task Force' to co-develop new metrics with the department heads.",
        expertRationale: "This is a bold, strategic move. It is risky because it directly calls out the client's political reality, but it is necessary to prevent failure.

Use their input to build a consensus proposal you can present to the CHRO as a 'Client-Led Solution,' making the heads feel ownership and minimising political fallout.",
        expertRationale: "This is a sophisticated political approach. It creates buy-in and uses internal momentum. The risk is that if the heads disagree fundamentally, you become a political messenger, potentially losing credibility. It delays the hard decision but increases the probability of a smoother execution.",
        expertRanking: 2

Document the pending regulatory change in the risk log, noting the expected cost of future rework. This protects your team's budget and schedule and forces the client to own the decision to accept future technical debt.",
        expertRationale: "This is a good risk-management move for the firm, but it's poor advisory. It gives the client what they asked for, not what they need. They will blame your firm when the rework is required, viewing you as an order-taker who failed to guide them strategically, despite the risk log.",

Present the 20 percent cost increase as an 'Insurance Premium' on the data layer, allowing them to defer the full regulatory change until Phase 2.",
        expertRationale: "This is a nuanced compromise that addresses both the timeline and the strategic risk. By modularising the architecture, you minimise the cost of future rework.

Stress that current compliance and future resilience are a single requirement.",
        expertRationale: "This is the strongest strategic stance, taking accountability for the client's long-term outcome. It forces the client to accept the necessary investment to avoid a costly, embarrassing rebuild later. The risk of friction is high, but the long-term value and respect earned are higher. This is true strategic leadership.",

        expertRationale: "This is a textbook strategic move: never optimise a silo at the expense of the system. You show a command of the end-to-end value chain.

        expertRationale: "This is a low-friction approach that allows the client to learn the hard lesson via data.
